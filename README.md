# raspberry-sx

Cyberdesck based on old [Commodore 64 SX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_SX-64). 

It uses a Raspberry Pi 4 with Wifi and 8Gb memory. There is an SSD attached to it using one of the USB 3.0 ports. The other USB 3.0 is used to attach a USB hub. On the USB 2.0 port is a keyboard attached and the other USB 2.0 port is used for the touch screen. It is powered by a powerbank, which is charged using a power supply. There is much place left in the cyberdeck to add other measuring instruments or a Pi modules cluster. 

It is open-source and you can adapt the design as you wish as long as you send me a pictures of your usage with a explanation of usage. 

And when we meet in person, you can also buy me a beer.
